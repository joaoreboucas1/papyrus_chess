# Papyrus Chess

**NOTE: this is a work in progress!**

Small chess program written in C.

## Build Dependencies

The developers who want to build the project by themselves must have `raylib` installed. The compilation process is usual:

```console
$ gcc -o chess chess.c
```

The code should be cross-platform so it should compile in both Windows and Linux.

## Running the Program

Just run the executable.

## TODO

Figure out a way to ship the application
